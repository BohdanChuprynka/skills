name: dream-skill
description: On-demand batch sync of Claude Code conversations to an Obsidian vault. Use when the user says "/dream-skill", "review dream queue", "process dream queue", "sweep dream queue", or asks to update wiki from a recent conversation. Runs a FIND→MAP→REDUCE→ROUTE→RECONCILE→REVIEW→APPLY→RECEIPT→MARKER pipeline over unprocessed transcripts. Type `/dream-skill --ignore` to mark the current chat private so it is never recorded into the vault (undo with `--unignore`).
version: 0.3.1

## Invocation modes

| Invocation | Mode |
|---|---|
| `/dream-skill` | On-demand run: opens a terminal review session. Runs FIND → MAP → REDUCE → ROUTE → RECONCILE → REVIEW → APPLY → RECEIPT → MARKER. |
| `/dream-skill --since <YYYY-MM-DD>` | Explicit window start override (passes `--since` to `"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/find-chats.sh"`). |
| `/dream-skill --all` | Full-history backfill (weekly-batched; only after pipeline is trusted). Passes `--all` to `"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/find-chats.sh"`. |
| `/dream-skill --dry-run` | Run the full pipeline but write nothing to the vault. Receipt is printed to stdout only. |
| `/dream-skill --ignore` | Mark THIS chat private — skip on next close. |
| `/dream-skill --unignore` | Undo `--ignore` for this chat. |
| `/dream-skill --help` | Print this table, env vars, state paths, and exit 0. |

## Model policy

Every LLM step in this pipeline runs on **Sonnet** (`model: sonnet` → Sonnet 4.6, `claude-sonnet-4-6`):

- **MAP** (Step 2) — one extraction subagent per chat. Dispatch with `model: sonnet`.
- **ROUTE** (Step 4) — batched judgments, default 15 candidates per Sonnet subagent (`DREAM_ROUTE_BATCH_SIZE`). Each batch shares one nav-context and must echo every `candidate_id`.
- **RECONCILE** (Step 5c) — page-grouped judgments, default 25 candidates per target-page Sonnet subagent (`DREAM_RECONCILE_BATCH_SIZE`). Each batch reads one vault page snapshot and must echo every `candidate_id`.

These are high-volume, tightly-specified steps (read one chat → emit candidate JSON; route a small candidate batch; reconcile one target page batch) that Sonnet handles well. Only the orchestrator that stitches the run together (the FIND / REDUCE / REVIEW / APPLY / RECEIPT / MARKER plumbing) runs on the session model. If you ever need maximum fidelity on the destructive-edit judgment, RECONCILE is the single step worth temporarily pinning back to a stronger model — but the default is Sonnet everywhere.

This is a dispatch-level setting (model + validated batch isolation): it does not change any data contract, so the deterministic test suites are unaffected.

## HARD RULES — read first, apply always

These rules override anything else in this skill. Violating them silently destroys the user's persona-sync.

### Rule 1 — Persistence target is Obsidian vaults ONLY

The ONLY valid write destinations are:
1. Files **inside vault roots** declared in `$DREAM_CONFIG` (via `vault-writer.sh`)
2. The queue file at `$DREAM_QUEUE_FILE` (via `queue.sh`)
3. The undo log at `$DREAM_UNDO_LOG` (managed by `vault-writer.sh`)
4. The error log at `$DREAM_ERROR_LOG` (plain append on failures)
5. The marker file at `${DREAM_MARKER_DIR:-$HOME/.claude/dream-skill}/last-run` (Step 9)
6. The receipt file in `reports_dir` (via `scripts/write-receipt.sh`)
7. The routing-gaps log at `${DREAM_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/dream-skill}/routing-gaps.log` (plain append when routing returns `ambiguous`/`gap` — Step 5a / R7)

You MUST NOT write to any of these:
- `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` — that is Claude Code's per-project auto-memory, a different persistence layer.
- Any path outside the vault roots in `$DREAM_CONFIG`
- Any path not under `$DREAM_HOME` or a configured vault root

### Rule 2 — Use the provided helper scripts, never improvise

Vault writes go through `scripts/vault-writer.sh`.
Queue appends go through `scripts/queue.sh`.
Receipts go through `scripts/write-receipt.sh`.
Apply decisions go through `scripts/apply-decision.sh` (Plan 3).
Never use the `Write`/`Edit` tools directly to mutate vault files.

### Rule 3 — Fail loud (in the log), exit gracefully to the user

If any required env var or script path is missing, append a structured error line to `$DREAM_ERROR_LOG` and stop that step. Do NOT try to find an alternative persistence layer.

### Rule 4 — Dry-run is mechanical

When `--dry-run` is active, pass `--dry-run` through to `apply-decision.sh` and `vault-writer.sh` unchanged. No conditional logic — every APPLY call carries the flag.

---

## State layout (env-var sourced)

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR` | (resolved at runtime) | Where vault-writer.sh, queue.sh, apply-decision.sh, write-receipt.sh, find-chats.sh live |
| `DREAM_HOME` | `~/.claude/dream-skill` | Runtime state root |
| `DREAM_CONFIG` | `$DREAM_HOME/config.toml` | Vault roots TOML |
| `DREAM_QUEUE_FILE` | `$DREAM_HOME/queue/pending.md` | Deferred-decision facts |
| `DREAM_DAILY_LOG` | `$DREAM_HOME/log/<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` | Human-readable activity log (deferred — not yet implemented) |
| `DREAM_UNDO_LOG` | `$DREAM_HOME/undo/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl` | Per-write rollback entries |
| `DREAM_ERROR_LOG` | `$DREAM_HOME/error.log` | Append on broken-install failures |
| `DREAM_MARKER_DIR` | `$DREAM_HOME` | Directory containing `last-run` marker file |

## Vault config

`$DREAM_CONFIG` is TOML. Each entry maps a logical vault name to its root directory:

```toml
[vaults.me]
root = "/path/to/me"
description = "Identity, skills, experience, projects, career"

[vaults.projects]
root = "/path/to/projects"
description = "Repos, architecture, goals, gotchas"

reports_dir = "/path/to/me/dream-reports"
```

Each vault root should have a `CLAUDE.md` (vault schema/conventions) and `wiki/index.md` (catalog). `vault-writer.sh` handles index auto-update.

If `$DREAM_CONFIG` doesn't exist or has no vault entries: prompt the user to configure it before proceeding.

---

## Orchestration

The on-demand pipeline runs in the following steps. Each step is described below.

### Step 0 — Pre-flight

1. Check the `--dry-run` flag. If set, no vault writes occur; receipt is printed to stdout only. Thread `--dry-run` to `apply-decision.sh` (Plan 3 makes this mechanical).
2. Check `--ignore` / `--unignore`. If present, update the private-state flag for the current transcript and exit. Do not proceed to FIND.
3. Resolve `DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR` robustly — works as a marketplace plugin OR a bare `~/.claude/skills` symlink. Run:

```bash
# Resolve the scripts dir robustly — works as a marketplace plugin OR a bare ~/.claude/skills symlink.
SKILL_DIR="<the base directory shown in this skill's invocation header>"
REAL="$(cd -P "$SKILL_DIR" && pwd)"              # follow symlink to the real skill dir
if [ -n "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ] && [ -x "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/find-chats.sh" ]; then
  DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR="$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts"            # plugin install
elif [ -x "$REAL/scripts/find-chats.sh" ]; then
  DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR="$REAL/scripts"                          # self-contained skill dir
elif [ -x "$REAL/../../scripts/find-chats.sh" ]; then
  DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR="$(cd -P "$REAL/../.." && pwd)/scripts"  # skills/<name>/ under a plugin root (current layout)
else
  echo "dream-skill: cannot locate scripts dir from $REAL — append to \$DREAM_ERROR_LOG and stop (Rule 3)." >&2
fi
DREAM_SKILL_HOME="$(dirname "$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR")"
ROUTING_MD="$DREAM_SKILL_HOME/ROUTING.md"
# Verify all helpers exist + executable; if any missing, fail loud (Rule 3) and stop.
_MISSING=""
for s in find-chats.sh private-state.sh prefilter-transcript.py build-map-batches.py write-receipt.sh queue.sh vault-writer.sh apply-decision.sh apply-review-decisions.sh build-nav-context.sh validate-candidates.sh advance-marker.sh build-route-batches.py validate-route-batch.py build-reconcile-batches.py validate-reconcile-batch.py build-review-queue.py serve-review.py; do
  [ -x "$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/$s" ] || { echo "dream-skill: missing $s in $DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR" >&2; _MISSING="$_MISSING $s"; }
done
[ -r "$ROUTING_MD" ] || { echo "dream-skill: missing ROUTING.md at $ROUTING_MD" >&2; _MISSING="$_MISSING ROUTING.md"; }
[ -z "$_MISSING" ] || { echo "dream-skill: aborting — missing scripts:$_MISSING" >&2; exit 1; }

# Private run scratch dir for MAP prefiltered transcripts and batch files.
DREAM_HOME="${DREAM_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/dream-skill}"
mkdir -p "$DREAM_HOME/tmp"
umask 077
WORKDIR="$(mktemp -d "$DREAM_HOME/tmp/run-XXXXXX")"
trap 'rm -rf "$WORKDIR"' EXIT
```
4. Parse `~/.claude/dream-skill/config.toml` (override via `${DREAM_CONFIG}` for tests) to resolve vault roots and `reports_dir`. Parse vault names from `^\[vaults\.<name>\]`, then `root =` per block; `reports_dir =` at top level. `config.toml` is the ONLY source of vault roots — no fallback to `CLAUDE.md` grep.

### Step 1 — FIND

Run:
```bash
"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/find-chats.sh" [--since <date>] [--all]
```

Parse stdout into a list of `(batch_start, batch_end, [transcript_paths...])` tuples by consuming `BATCH:<start>:<end>` header lines.

**No-marker prompt:** If `"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/find-chats.sh"` emits no BATCH header (marker missing and no flag), prompt the user:
> No last-run marker found. Choose a window:
> 1. Last 7 days (default — recommended for first run)
> 2. Since <date> (enter a YYYY-MM-DD date)
> 3. All history (--all; weekly-batched; only after pipeline is trusted)

Then re-invoke `"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/find-chats.sh"` with the chosen flag.

**Empty result:** If a batch contains zero transcript paths, skip to RECEIPT for that batch (write a receipt noting "0 chats in window") and advance the marker — **unless `--dry-run` is active, in which case the marker is never advanced** (I3).

### Step 2 — MAP

**Step 2a — Prefilter.** For each batch, prefilter each raw transcript path before dispatch. MAP agents read only the filtered text; the raw transcript path is retained only for provenance:

```bash
transcript="<absolute raw transcript path>"
safe_id="$(python3 -c 'import hashlib, sys; print(hashlib.sha256(sys.argv[1].encode()).hexdigest())' "$transcript")"
FILTERED_TRANSCRIPT="$WORKDIR/map-prefilter-$safe_id.txt"
SOURCE_DATE="$(python3 -c 'import datetime, pathlib, sys; print(datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(pathlib.Path(sys.argv[1]).stat().st_mtime).date())' "$transcript")"
"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/prefilter-transcript.py" --stats "$transcript" > "$FILTERED_TRANSCRIPT"
```

Collect every prefiltered transcript into a manifest array of `{"raw","filtered","source_date"}` objects (`$MAP_MANIFEST_JSON`).

**Step 2b — Build single-Read MAP units.** The Read tool rejects any file whose content exceeds ~25,000 tokens. A large filtered transcript therefore forces an extraction agent into many windowed Read calls, and the API re-bills the whole accumulated context on every turn — the **multi-turn multiplier**. In a real run, one 963 KB chat cost ~1.5M tokens (read across ~16 windows) and produced **zero** candidate facts. `build-map-batches.py` removes the multiplier *without dropping content*: big transcripts are split on line boundaries into overlapping ≤85 KB **chunks** (one agent reads one chunk in a single Read; no agent re-reads another's chunk, so content enters context exactly once); small transcripts are first-fit packed into ≤85 KB **bundles** (dozens of tiny chats collapse into a handful of agents). Every original line lands in at least one unit (chunk overlap keeps boundary-spanning facts whole). Unit tested via `tests/test_build_map_batches.sh`.

```bash
printf '%s' "$MAP_MANIFEST_JSON" | \
  "$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/build-map-batches.py" --workdir "$WORKDIR" > "$WORKDIR/map-units.json"
```

Each descriptor is `{"batch_id","kind":"chunk","unit_path","source_chat","source_date","part","of"}` (a slice of one chat) or `{"batch_id","kind":"bundle","unit_path","members":[{"source_chat","source_date"}]}` (several chats, with in-band `===== DREAM-MAP-UNIT source_chat=... source_date=... =====` separators). Dispatch ONE subagent per unit using the Task/Agent tool, **with `model: sonnet`** (see Model policy).

**Dispatch prompt (verbatim — fill `<unit_path>`, and for chunk units `<source_chat>` / `<source_date>`):**

> You are a dream-skill extraction agent. Read the MAP unit at `<unit_path>` with a SINGLE Read call — it is ≤85 KB and fits in one read. Do NOT make multiple Read calls, do NOT re-read the file, do NOT open any raw transcript. Extract every fact about Bohdan that belongs in bucket A (additive personal fact) or buckets D/E (queued items), using the extraction taxonomy in SKILL.md.
>
> Provenance:
> - If the unit contains `===== DREAM-MAP-UNIT source_chat=<path> source_date=<date> =====` separator lines, it bundles several chats: attribute each fact to the `source_chat` and `source_date` of the separator block the fact came from.
> - Otherwise the unit is one slice of a single chat: set `source_chat` exactly to `<source_chat>` and `source_date` exactly to `<source_date>` on every fact.
>
> Rules:
> - Apply the five-bucket taxonomy above (A=write-candidate, B/C=drop, D/E=queue).
> - Output ONLY a JSON array of candidate-fact objects matching this schema exactly (overview §4):
>   `[{"content":"...","confidence":"high|medium|low","source_chat":"<path>","source_date":"<YYYY-MM-DD>","type":"...","evidence":"...","suggested_section":"..."}]`
> - Required fields: `content`, `confidence`, `source_chat`, `source_date`. Optional: `type`, `evidence`, `suggested_section`.
> - Do NOT include `needs_review`, `target_hint`, or `section` — those are set by routing and reconciliation.
> - An empty array `[]` is valid for code-only or private units.
> - Do NOT invent facts. Do NOT route or reconcile. Extract only.

Each subagent returns a JSON array of candidate facts. Validate the JSON structure using the `validate_candidates` harness (required fields ONLY: `content`, `confidence`, `source_chat`, `source_date`), then normalize provenance deterministically **by unit kind** so temp file paths can never leak and mis-attribution is caught. Any subagent output that is not valid JSON, or is missing any required field, is logged as an extraction error and skipped. Missing optional fields (`type`, `evidence`, `suggested_section`) never cause a candidate to be dropped.

**JSON validation harness — use the helper script (Rule 2), do not re-implement:**

Validation lives in `"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/validate-candidates.sh"` — the single source of truth (unit-tested via `tests/test_map_harness.sh`, which sources this same script; golden inputs in `tests/fixtures/map/`). It filters a candidate array to items carrying all 4 required fields and errors on non-array input. Run it per unit output, then apply kind-specific normalization:

```bash
# Validate one unit's JSON array; VALID is the filtered array, or empty on error.
VALID=$(printf '%s' "$subagent_json" | "$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/validate-candidates.sh") \
  || { echo "MAP: invalid candidate JSON (not an array) — skipping this unit" >&2; VALID="[]"; }

# chunk unit → overwrite provenance with the descriptor's pinned raw path + date:
VALID=$(printf '%s' "$VALID" | jq --arg source_chat "$unit_source_chat" --arg source_date "$unit_source_date" \
  'map(.source_chat = $source_chat | .source_date = $source_date)')

# bundle unit → keep only candidates whose source_chat is a declared member and
# pin its source_date from that member; mis-attributed candidates are dropped:
VALID=$(printf '%s' "$VALID" | jq --argjson members "$members_json" \
  '[ .[] | . as $c | ($members[] | select(.source_chat == $c.source_chat)) as $m
     | $c + {source_date: $m.source_date} ]')
```

It checks ONLY the 4 required fields (`content`, `confidence`, `source_chat`, `source_date`); optional fields (`type`, `evidence`, `suggested_section`) never cause a drop. Chunk overlap can surface a boundary fact in two adjacent units — REDUCE (Step 3) dedups by exact `(content, suggested_section)`, so duplicates collapse automatically.

### Step 3 — REDUCE

After all MAP subagents complete for a batch, merge their outputs. REDUCE is **structural only** — it deduplicates by exact string match on `(content, suggested_section)` and counts distinct `source_chat` values. It NEVER clears `needs_review`, NEVER auto-approves, and NEVER applies semantic equivalence judgments.

1. Flatten all candidate arrays into a single pool.
2. Deduplicate by exact case-insensitive `(content, suggested_section)` pair. Keep the highest-confidence copy; if equal confidence, keep the one with the most `evidence` text. Carry `source_date` through from the kept copy.
3. For facts where N ≥ 2 distinct `source_chat` values share the exact same `(content, suggested_section)`:
   - `N = 2`: raise confidence label to `medium` if currently `low`.
   - `N ≥ 3`: raise confidence label to `high` if currently below `high`.
   - Confidence promotion is the ONLY action REDUCE takes. It does NOT set `needs_review`, does NOT approve facts.
4. Output: a single deduplicated array of candidate-fact objects, with a `source_chat_count` field added to each fact (integer count of distinct source chats that surfaced it).

### Step 4 — ROUTE

Build stable-ID batches from the reduced candidate array, then pass each batch to the routing logic defined in `## Routing` (defined below). Execute the routing prompt as one Sonnet subagent per batch (`model: sonnet`, see Model policy), default 15 candidates per batch.

```bash
printf '%s' "$REDUCED_CANDIDATES_JSON" | \
  "$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/build-route-batches.py" > "$WORKDIR/route-batches.json"
```

Each route agent receives one `route-batch` object plus the shared nav-context and `ROUTING.md`, and emits one route decision per `candidate_id`. Validate every agent output before fan-in:

```bash
"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/validate-route-batch.py" \
  --batch "$WORKDIR/route-batch-0001.json" < "$AGENT_ROUTE_JSON"
```

The validator joins routes back to their original candidates and proves the batch output has no missing, extra, duplicated, or malformed `candidate_id`s. Merge validated outputs into one routed-record array. If `## Routing` is not yet present in this file, log a gap and queue all candidates as `uncertain`.

### Step 5 — RECONCILE

For the validated routed-record array, perform the following sub-steps (overview §5):

**Step 5a — Route status check:** Before building reconcile batches, scan the validated routed-record array. If a routing decision has `status != "routed"` (i.e. `ambiguous`, `gap`, or similar), mark `needs_review = true`, append to `${DREAM_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/dream-skill}/routing-gaps.log` with timestamp + fact content, route to the `uncertain` queue bucket, and exclude that candidate from reconciliation.

**Step 5b — Build page-grouped batches:** Pass the validated routed-record array to the reconcile batch builder:
```bash
printf '%s' "$ROUTED_RECORDS_JSON" | \
  "$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/build-reconcile-batches.py" \
    --config "$DREAM_CONFIG" \
    --run-date "<today YYYY-MM-DD>" \
    > "$WORKDIR/reconcile-batches.json"
```

`build-reconcile-batches.py` groups by `(vault,page)`, resolves the page through `config.toml`, reads the full page text once per group (empty string if the page does not exist), and preserves each candidate's routed section inside the candidate entry.

**Step 5c — RECONCILE prompt:** Pass each reconcile batch to the `## Reconciliation` logic. Execute it as one Sonnet subagent per target-page batch (`model: sonnet`, see Model policy):
```json
{
  "batch_id": "reconcile-0001",
  "target": { "vault": "me", "page": "wiki/bio.md" },
  "target_page": "<full markdown text of the routed vault page, or empty string>",
  "run_date": "<today YYYY-MM-DD>",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "candidate_id": "c000001",
      "candidate": { "...full candidate-fact object including source_date..." },
      "route": { "vault": "me", "page": "wiki/bio.md", "section": "Bio", "routing_confidence": "high" }
    }
  ]
}
```

Each agent emits an array with one decision per `candidate_id`. Validate every output before apply:

```bash
"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/validate-reconcile-batch.py" \
  --batch "$WORKDIR/reconcile-batch-0001.json" < "$AGENT_RECONCILE_JSON"
```

The validator proves every routed candidate received exactly one decision, the decision target matches the batch page and that candidate's routed section, and the reconciliation decision fields satisfy the action/mode/review contract. Each candidate receives a reconciliation decision per overview §4: `action`, `mode`, `target`, `old_content`, `content`, `candidate_confidence`, `needs_review`, `rationale`. Field is `rationale` (not `reason`).

**Step 5d — Apply:** Feed the reconciliation decision to `apply-decision.sh` (Plan 3). `apply-decision.sh` owns the action→mode→vault-writer mapping. The orchestrator does NOT re-implement this mapping — it passes the decision through unchanged. Always pass `--candidate-id <candidate_id>` so queued items get a sidecar JSON written to `$DREAM_HOME/queue/sidecars/` (needed by the web review UI in Step 6).

```bash
"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/apply-decision.sh" \
  --vault        "<abs vault root>" \
  --decision     "<path-to-decision.json>" \
  --undo-log     "$DREAM_UNDO_LOG" \
  --candidate-id "<candidate_id>"
```

### Step 6 — REVIEW

Launch the web flip-card review UI. Medium and low confidence items queued in Step 5d are shown as swipeable cards. The user approves (→), discards (←), or defers to next run (↑) each fact.

**Step 6a — Build the review queue JSON:**

```bash
REVIEW_INPUT="$DREAM_HOME/queue/review-input.json"
REVIEW_DECISIONS="$DREAM_HOME/queue/review-decisions.json"
python3 "$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/build-review-queue.py" \
  --pending-md    "$DREAM_QUEUE_FILE" \
  --sidecars-dir  "$DREAM_HOME/queue/sidecars" \
  --output        "$REVIEW_INPUT" \
  --existing-decisions "$REVIEW_DECISIONS"
```

**Step 6b — Launch the server (blocks until user hits "Finish"):**

```bash
python3 "$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/serve-review.py" \
  --queue     "$REVIEW_INPUT" \
  --decisions "$REVIEW_DECISIONS" \
  --web       "$DREAM_SKILL_HOME/web" \
  --port 5174
# Server blocks here. Opens http://localhost:5174/ in the browser automatically.
# When user clicks "Finish — hand back to Claude", POST /api/shutdown fires and serve-review.py exits.
```

Tell the user: *"Opening review UI at http://localhost:5174/ — use → to approve, ← to discard, ↑ to defer to next run. Click 'Finish' when done."*

**Step 6c — Apply decisions after the server exits:**

```bash
REVIEW_FACTS=$("$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/apply-review-decisions.sh" \
  --decisions    "$REVIEW_DECISIONS" \
  --sidecars-dir "$DREAM_HOME/queue/sidecars" \
  --undo-log     "$DREAM_UNDO_LOG")
# $REVIEW_FACTS: JSON fact lines from approved writes (same format as Step 5d output)
# Append these to the RECEIPT fact lines collected in Step 7.
```

**Skip review (dry-run or empty queue):** If `--dry-run` is active or `review-input.json` contains 0 undecided entries, skip Steps 6a–6c — no server is launched.

### Step 7 — APPLY

For each fact promoted from REVIEW (approved in Step 6), call `apply-decision.sh` with the stored reconciliation decision JSON. (Auto-approved high-confidence `new` facts are already written in Step 5d — do not re-apply them here.) The orchestrator resolves `target.vault` (a logical name like `me`) to its absolute root via `config.toml` before calling, and collects apply-decision's emitted run-summary fact line(s) from stdout for the Step 8 receipt.

```bash
FACT_JSON=$("$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/apply-decision.sh" \
  [--dry-run] \
  --vault    "<abs root resolved from target.vault via config.toml>" \
  --decision '<path-to-decision-json>' \
  --undo-log "$DREAM_UNDO_LOG")
# $FACT_JSON is one JSON line per action (contradict emits two lines)
```

`apply-decision.sh` (Plan 3) maps `action` + `mode` to the correct `vault-writer.sh` invocation and emits one run-summary fact JSON line to stdout per action (contradict emits two: one written-old, one queued-new). The orchestrator passes the decision through unchanged and accumulates the emitted fact lines for Step 8.

On vault-writer non-zero exit: log the error to `$DREAM_ERROR_LOG`; continue to the next fact; do NOT advance the marker.

### Step 8 — RECEIPT

After all APPLY calls for a batch complete, assemble the run-summary JSON from the fact lines emitted by `apply-decision.sh` in Step 7 (`.facts[]` is the array of run-summary fact objects collected from apply-decision's stdout), then pipe it to `write-receipt.sh`. Pass `DREAM_RUNS_DIR` to supply the reports directory.

```bash
# Build run-summary JSON from accumulated apply-decision stdout fact lines.
# Each line from Step 7's $FACT_JSON captures is one element of .facts[].
RUN_SUMMARY=$(jq -cn \
  --arg run_id        "<run_id>" \
  --arg date          "<batch_end_date>" \
  --arg window_start  "<batch_start_date>" \
  --arg window_end    "<batch_end_date>" \
  --argjson chats_scanned "<number_of_transcript_paths_in_this_batch>" \
  --argjson facts     "<json-array of run-summary fact lines from Step 7>" \
  '{run_id:$run_id, date:$date, window_start:$window_start, window_end:$window_end, chats_scanned:$chats_scanned, facts:$facts}')

printf '%s' "$RUN_SUMMARY" | \
  DREAM_RUNS_DIR="<reports_dir from config>" \
  "$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/write-receipt.sh" [--dry-run]
```

`write-receipt.sh` accepts only `--dry-run` and `--config`; all other metadata is passed via stdin in the run-summary JSON. `.facts[]` is assembled by collecting apply-decision's emitted run-summary fact lines from Step 7.

**If `--dry-run`:** print the receipt to stdout instead of writing to `reports_dir`.

**If receipt write fails:** log to `$DREAM_ERROR_LOG`; still advance the marker (receipt failure is not a vault-integrity issue).

### Step 9 — MARKER advance

Only after a batch's APPLY + RECEIPT completes without fatal error — **and never on a `--dry-run`**:

```bash
# A dry-run is a zero-mutation preview: it must NOT advance the marker, or the next
# real run would silently skip the previewed window (see REVIEW-2026-06-04 I3).
# advance-marker.sh owns this guard (no-op on --dry-run); tested in test_advance_marker.sh.
MARKER_FLAGS=""
[ "${DRY_RUN:-0}" = "1" ] && MARKER_FLAGS="--dry-run"
"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/advance-marker.sh" --date "<batch_end_date>" $MARKER_FLAGS
```

If `--dry-run` is active, do NOT advance the marker under any circumstance. If the run failed during APPLY (vault-writer exited non-zero), also do NOT advance the marker. The next invocation will re-process the same window; vault-writer's idempotency ensures safe re-runs.

For `--all` (multi-batch) runs, the marker advances after each individual batch, so a mid-run failure leaves the marker at the last successfully completed batch boundary.

### Error handling

- MAP subagent fails (non-zero exit or invalid JSON): log the error, skip that transcript, continue.
- ROUTE returns gap/ambiguous: add to gaps log + review queue; never a silent guess.
- APPLY vault-writer exits non-zero: log + continue to next fact; do NOT advance marker if any write fails.
- Receipt write fails: log to `$DREAM_ERROR_LOG`; still advance marker (receipt failure is not a vault-integrity issue).

---

## Extraction taxonomy

Scan each transcript. For each candidate fact, classify into one of these buckets.

**Meta-session rule (important):** If the transcript is about building/debugging dream-skill itself, do NOT blanket-skip as "recursive." Look for concrete decisions the user made: architecture picks, file paths committed to, technical choices, version bumps, default values changed. Those ARE persona signal about their work and belong in vault. Only skip the literal back-and-forth ("yes", "do it", "looks good") as Bucket B execution-confirmations.

### Bucket A — HIGH CONFIDENCE, ADDITIVE → write candidate

**Default to WRITE, not queue.** Queue is an escape hatch for genuinely ambiguous facts, NOT the default. If you find yourself queuing 5+ facts in one run and writing 0, you are being too cautious — re-classify.

A fact qualifies as Bucket A if ALL of:
- New information about the user OR about a project/topic the user is working on (role, project, deadline, preference, decision, relationship, body/health, learning, schedule, technical choice, architecture pick)
- Vault has no current fact that contradicts it
- The user themselves stated it OR the assistant stated it and the user confirmed (acceptance, "yes", "do it", building on it)
- Stated as fact or decision, not pure hypothesis

**Concrete qualifying examples** (emit these, don't queue):
- User picks a tech stack ("we're using Postgres + Drizzle")
- User commits to a project direction ("v0.2 will ship Haiku as default model")
- User states a date or deadline ("Cycle 4 ends 2026-08-17")
- User defines a workflow ("close session → SessionEnd → headless")
- User makes an architecture call ("use add-only writes + queue for destructive")

### Bucket B — GENERAL-KNOWLEDGE Q&A → drop UNLESS signal-bearing

If the user asked a generic technical question and got a generic answer, **drop** (emit nothing).

BUT if the question itself reveals user signal — out-of-domain question, surprising knowledge gap, change in focus area — route to queue under `brainstormed` as a "user explored X today" note.

### Bucket C — CODE BLOCKS → drop UNLESS conceptual

If the conversation is pure code-paste/edit loop: **drop** (emit nothing).

BUT if surrounding prose discusses a concept, architecture decision, or pattern the user is learning/choosing, summarize the **concept** (not the code) as a candidate fact and re-run through Bucket A logic.

### Bucket D — DESTRUCTIVE EDIT → queue

A fact is destructive if it CONTRADICTS or REPLACES existing vault content. Examples: "I'm no longer doing X" (vault still says they do X), "actually it's Y not Z" (vault has Z).

Emit with `confidence` set appropriately; `suggested_section` pointing to the target page. Flag as bucket D in the `type` field if helpful (e.g. `"type": "destructive"`). The reconciler will detect the contradiction.

### Bucket E — UNCERTAIN or BRAINSTORMED → queue

- Medium/low confidence additive fact → emit with `confidence: "medium"` or `"low"`
- User brainstormed an idea but didn't commit ("maybe I should X", "thinking about Y") → emit with `confidence: "low"` and `type: "belief"` or `type: "observation"`

## Private opt-out mode (`--ignore` / `--unignore`)

**Interactive, confirmation-only. Writes nothing to the vault — the skip is enforced at the next FIND step.**

When invoked as `/dream-skill --ignore`:

> This chat is now private. dream-skill will skip it during the next on-demand run — nothing from this conversation will be written to your Obsidian vault. Undo anytime with `/dream-skill --unignore`.

When invoked as `/dream-skill --unignore`:

> This chat is no longer private. dream-skill will include it in the next on-demand run as usual.

**How it works:** typing the command leaves a record in the transcript. At FIND time, `scripts/find-chats.sh` calls `scripts/private-state.sh` per transcript and excludes those marked private. Decision is latest-wins and covers the whole chat.

## Rollback

To reverse all writes from a completed run:

```bash
"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/apply-undo.sh" --date <YYYY-MM-DD>
```

This reads `$DREAM_HOME/undo/<date>.jsonl`, reverses every vault-writer append/replace/stale, removes index entries, and renames the processed log to `.applied-*` to prevent re-runs. See `scripts/apply-undo.sh` and `tests/test_undo.sh`.

<!-- Routing and Reconciliation prompts live below this line. -->

## Routing

> **When to run:** once per ROUTE batch, after REDUCE produces a deduplicated candidate-fact array and before the Reconciliation step.

### Inputs

1. **`route-batch` JSON** — the object from `build-route-batches.py`, shaped as:
   ```json
   {
     "batch_id": "route-0001",
     "candidates": [
       { "candidate_id": "c000001", "candidate": { "...candidate-fact fields..." } }
     ]
   }
   ```
2. **`nav-context` block** — the output of `"$DREAM_SCRIPTS_DIR/build-nav-context.sh"` (reads `~/.claude/dream-skill/config.toml` by default; override with `--config <toml-path>` for tests). Contains, for each vault: 1-line purpose (from config `description`), `wiki/index.md` entries (up to 40 lines), and a dir-scan listing of pages.
3. **`ROUTING.md`** — the disambiguation + volatility supplement (read from `$ROUTING_MD`).

### Routing procedure (follow in order)

For each item in `route-batch.candidates`, route the embedded `candidate` independently using R1-R7 below. Keep the `candidate_id` attached to the output decision. Do not infer one candidate's route from another candidate in the same batch unless they are genuinely the same subject and the nav-context makes the same target canonical.

**Step R1 — Read `$ROUTING_MD` §1 disambiguation rules.** Apply the first matching rule to the candidate fact. Note which rule fired and why.

**Step R2 — Confirm the vault in nav-context.** After picking the vault, scan the nav-context block for that vault's `index` and `pages on disk`. Identify the single most specific page that matches the candidate. The page must exist either in the index entries or the dir scan. If no page exists yet → do NOT invent a path; emit `status: gap`.

**Step R3 — Determine the section.** Use `suggested_section` from the candidate if it matches a heading that exists or would logically exist in the target page. Otherwise, infer from the vault CLAUDE.md's page format (visible in the nav-context purpose line or index entry description).

**Step R4 — Apply confidence calibration from ROUTING.md §4.**

**Step R5 — Check for ambiguity.** If after R1–R4 two or more vault+page pairs remain equally plausible with no disambiguation rule resolving them → emit `status: ambiguous`.

**Step R6 — Check for gap.** If no vault rule matched in R1 and no vault page is a reasonable fit → emit `status: gap`.

**Step R7 — If status is `ambiguous` or `gap`:** append one line to the routing-gaps log at `${DREAM_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/dream-skill}/routing-gaps.log` (NOT into `ROUTING.md` — that file is hand-maintained read-only routing guidance) using this format:
```
- <source_date> | <content truncated to 80 chars> | <reason> | proposed-rule: <optional>
```

### Output format

Emit **one JSON array** and nothing else. It must contain exactly one object per input `candidate_id`:

```json
[
  {
    "candidate_id": "c000001",
    "status": "routed",
    "vault": "<vault-name>",
    "page": "<relative-path-from-vault-root>",
    "section": "<section heading>",
    "routing_confidence": "high | medium | low"
  }
]
```

For `ambiguous` or `gap`, set `vault`, `page`, and `section` to `null`.

### Hard constraints

- Output item fields are exactly `candidate_id`, `status`, `vault`, `page`, `section`, `routing_confidence` — no extras (`canonical_path`, `routing_status`, `needs_review`, etc.).
- Every input `candidate_id` MUST appear exactly once. No missing IDs, no duplicate IDs, no invented IDs.
- `status` values are exactly `"routed"`, `"ambiguous"`, or `"gap"` — no other strings.
- `page` must be a relative path from the vault root. Never an absolute path.
- The page must resolve to a CANONICAL page that exists (per nav-context index or dir scan) or be `null`. Never invent a path.
- For `ambiguous` or `gap`: `vault`, `page`, and `section` are always `null`; append to the routing-gaps log (Step R7).
- `routing_confidence` is one of `"high"`, `"medium"`, or `"low"` — calibrated per ROUTING.md §4.

## Reconciliation

> This section is the LLM prompt executed by the orchestrator once per target-page
> batch. Input: one `target_page` snapshot, `run_date` (ISO-8601, today's date),
> and an array of routed candidates for that page. Output: one JSON array with one
> reconciliation decision per `candidate_id`. Emit JSON only — no prose.

### Input schema

```json
{
  "batch_id": "reconcile-0001",
  "target": { "vault": "me", "page": "wiki/experience.md" },
  "target_page": "<full markdown text of the routed vault page>",
  "run_date": "2026-06-03",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "candidate_id": "c000001",
      "candidate": {
        "content": "Cleveland Clinic internship confirmed for Jun-Aug 2026",
        "type": "world-fact | belief | observation | experience",
        "confidence": "high | medium | low",
        "evidence": "short quote/paraphrase from the source chat",
        "source_chat": "<session-id>",
        "source_date": "2026-06-01",
        "suggested_section": "Experience"
      },
      "route": {
        "vault": "me",
        "page": "wiki/experience.md",
        "section": "Experience",
        "routing_confidence": "high"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output schema

```json
[
  {
    "candidate_id": "c000001",
    "decision": {
      "action": "new | duplicate | supersede | contradict",
      "mode": "append | replace | stale | none",
      "target": {
        "vault": "<vault-name>",
        "page": "<relative path, e.g. wiki/experience.md>",
        "section": "<H2 heading text>"
      },
      "old_content": "<exact existing line text, omit key for 'new' and 'duplicate'>",
      "content": "<the new fact line to write; use empty string for 'duplicate'>",
      "candidate_confidence": "high | medium | low",
      "needs_review": true,
      "rationale": "<one sentence explaining the classification>"
    }
  }
]
```

The validator also accepts the decision fields directly beside `candidate_id`, but the wrapped `{candidate_id, decision}` shape above is preferred.

Field notes (from v2 §4):
- `action` enum is EXACTLY `new|duplicate|supersede|contradict` (never mode-values).
- `mode` is `append|replace|stale|none` — use `none` for `duplicate`.
- `candidate_confidence` is a REQUIRED pass-through of the candidate's `confidence` field; it drives queue bucketing in `apply-decision.sh`.
- Field is `rationale` (not `reason`).
- **`needs_review` rule:** `false` for `duplicate`, and false for `action: new` with `candidate_confidence: high`; `true` for destructive edits, contradictions, and low/medium-confidence new facts.
- `target.vault` and `target.page` come from the batch `target`; `target.section` comes from that candidate's `route.section`.
- Every input `candidate_id` MUST appear exactly once. No missing IDs, no duplicate IDs, no invented IDs.

### Action definitions and mode mapping

| Action       | When to use                                                        | mode    | needs_review |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| `new`        | The fact (or one semantically equivalent) is absent from the page | append  | false if confidence=high; true otherwise |
| `duplicate`  | An existing line carries the same meaning (wording may differ)    | none    | false |
| `supersede`  | Same subject+attribute, candidate value is newer/more specific    | replace | true |
| `contradict` | Conflicting claims, winner unclear (no clear date precedence)     | stale   | true |

**For `duplicate`:** emit `"mode": "none"` and `"content": ""` (empty string) as placeholders — `none` is the correct mode value per v2 §4. The dispatcher skips any write because the fact is already represented. Do NOT omit the `mode` and `content` keys — the schema validator requires all fields.

**For `contradict`:** `mode` is `stale` (the existing line is struck through); the new candidate is queued for human review but NOT written. Set `old_content` to the conflicting existing line.

### Precedence rules (apply in order)

1. **User's words in the source chat always win** — if the candidate came from a direct user statement in the session, treat it as authoritative over any existing vault claim.
2. **Newer `source_date` beats older vault content** — when both a candidate and an existing line reference the same subject+attribute, the one with the later date supersedes. If the existing line has no date marker, treat it as older.
3. **`confidence: low` (brainstormed/hypothetical) never auto-writes** — force `needs_review: true` for `new`, `supersede`, or `contradict`. `duplicate` still skips with `needs_review: false`.
4. **Ambiguous precedence → `contradict`** — when you cannot determine which claim is more recent or authoritative, classify as `contradict`, not `supersede`.

### Volatility guidance

The target page's frontmatter or the vault's `CLAUDE.md` may carry a `volatility` tag (`VOLATILE` or `STABLE`). Use it as follows:

- **VOLATILE page** (e.g. `goals/now`, current-project status, active sprint): actively scan every existing line in the candidate's section for a semantically stale version of the same fact. When found, classify as `supersede` rather than `new`.
- **STABLE page** (e.g. past experience, education, completed projects): prefer `new` (append) unless an exact or near-exact duplicate is present. Do not hunt for supersession targets.
- **No tag / unknown**: treat as STABLE.

### Semantic equivalence (duplicate detection)

Two lines are **semantically equivalent** if a competent reader would consider them to convey the same fact about the same subject, even if the wording differs. Examples:

- `"interned at Cleveland Clinic"` ≅ `"Cleveland Clinic internship Jun–Aug 2026"` → **duplicate** (same role, same org)
- `"lives in Berlin"` ≠ `"lives in Munich"` → same attribute, different value → **supersede** or **contradict**
- `"knows Python"` ≅ `"Python (proficient)"` → **duplicate**
- `"interested in ML"` ≠ `"working on ML project"` → different claim level → **new** (additive, not a duplicate)

### Worked examples

**Example A — new (absent fact, high confidence)**
```
candidate.content = "Passed AWS Solutions Architect exam 2026-05"
candidate.confidence = "high"
target_page (skills.md) has no mention of AWS certification
→ action: "new", mode: "append", needs_review: false
```

**Example B — duplicate**
```
candidate.content = "Python (proficient)"
target_page (skills.md) already contains line "- knows Python"
→ action: "duplicate", mode: "none", content: "", needs_review: false
```

**Example C — supersede**
```
candidate.content = "lives in Munich (moved 2026-06)"
candidate.source_date = "2026-06-03"
target_page (bio.md) contains "- lives in Berlin" (no date marker → treated as older)
→ action: "supersede", mode: "replace",
   old_content: "lives in Berlin",
   content: "lives in Munich (moved 2026-06)",
   needs_review: true
```

**Example D — contradict**
```
candidate.content = "primary language is TypeScript"
candidate.source_date = "2026-05-10"
target_page (skills.md) contains "- primary language is Python (since 2023)"
Both have dates; TypeScript claim is newer but Python claim is qualified "since 2023";
winner is genuinely unclear → classify as contradict
→ action: "contradict", mode: "stale",
   old_content: "primary language is Python (since 2023)",
   needs_review: true
```

### Output rules

- Emit the reconciliation-decision JSON array and nothing else. No explanation, no markdown fencing.
- Every decision object MUST include all required keys: `action`, `mode`, `target`, `content`, `candidate_confidence`, `needs_review`, `rationale`.
- `old_content` is REQUIRED for `supersede` and `contradict`; OMIT the key entirely for `new` and `duplicate`.
- `content` for `duplicate` MUST be `""` (empty string), not omitted.
- `target.vault` and `target.page` come from the batch target; do not re-derive them.
- `target.section` comes from the candidate's routed section; do not re-derive it.
- `candidate_confidence` is a verbatim copy of `candidate.confidence` — never change it.
